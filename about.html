      <p class="title">Who developed the web application?</p>
      <p class="text">The application was made by Owen Brouwer, a CMGT student at Hogeschool Rotterdam. He was bron on November 7th in 2002.</p><br/>

      <p class="title">For what reason did they make this application?</p>
      <p class="text">The application was made with one main purpose in mind, to encourage people to schedule a checkup with their doctors. There are more than 38 thousand deaths caused by heart disease in the netherlands alone. Among these deaths are a lot of people that didnt even know they had a heart disease. For this single reason we are trying to give people an insight into their health.</p><br/>

      <p class="title">The AI said i have a heart disease, am i going to die?</p>
      <p class="text">The AI compares your given data with existing data to determin if you have heart disease. The AI does this with an accuracy of 87%. There is no reason to panic if the AI says you have a heart disease, since there is always a chance that the AI is wrong. That is why we implore you to make a appointment with your doctor, so you can check if you really do have heart disease. This way you will most likely be able to get it treated right away.</p><br/>
