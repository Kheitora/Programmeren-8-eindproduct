      <p class="text">On this page you will find an explanation about the application, the algorithm and what the purpose of this project is. If you want to see more of the workings of the algorithm go to the info page in </p>
      <p class="text">the menu. If you don't want to know how any of this works and just want to know if you have a heartdisease, go to the predict page in the menu at the top of ur screen to fill out a form.</p> <br/> 
    
    <h1 class="text">The project</h1>
    <p class="text">As of now more than 38 thousand people die of some type of heart disease in the netherlands alone. By making this application i hope to give people an insight into their own body. I also hope that this will somehow initialize people to make a doctors appointment for a checkup, or just schedule regular checkups, as many people don't know that they have heart disease untill it's too late.</p><br/>


    <h1 class="text">Decision tree</h1> 
    <p class="text">A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a "test" on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome </p>
    <p class="text">of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes). The paths from root to leaf represent classification rules.</p><br/>
    <p class="text">In decision analysis, a decision tree and the closely related influence diagram are used as a visual and analytical decision support tool, where the expected values (or expected utility) of competing alternatives are calculated.</p><br/>
    <p class = "text">A decision tree consists of three types of nodes:</p><br/>
    <p class="text">Decision nodes - typically represented by squares</p>
    <p class="text">Chance nodes - typically represented by circles</p>
    <p class="text">End nodes - typically represented by triangles</p><br/>    
    <p class="text">Decision trees are commonly used in operations research and operations management. If, in practice, decisions have to be taken online with no recall under incomplete knowledge, a decision tree should be paralleled by a probability model as a best choice model or online selection model algorithm. Another use of decision trees is as a descriptive means for calculating conditional probabilities.</p><br/>    
    <p class="text">Decision trees, influence diagrams, utility functions, and other decision analysis tools and methods are taught to undergraduate students in schools of business, health economics, and public health, and are examples of operations research or management science methods.</p>
